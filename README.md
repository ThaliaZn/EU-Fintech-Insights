## _Project Overview_

Hey there, curious minds! 
Let's dive into my Internet Usage Analysis Project within the European Union (EU) and uncover the fascinating world of internet habits across EU countries, armed with some stellar data from Eurostat that I've carefully curated and polished.

<b>Whatâ€™s on the Horizon</b> :
- Our mission: unraveling the fascinating web of internet habits across the EU.
- Eurostat's data is our trusty companion, guiding us through the twists and turns.
- Key demographics like age, income, and education level take center stage.
- We're keeping a close eye on everyone's online antics, especially in the fintech realm.

In this digital journey, you'll meet the <b>Synthetic Data Generator</b>, powered by <b>Python</b>, accompanied by clear visuals crafted with <b>Matplotlib</b> and <b>Seaborn</b>, showing how demographics work. The project is complemented by interactive plots crafted using <b>Power BI</b>, giving you a front-row seat to the insights.

So, get ready for an adventure where data, Python, and Power BI team up to tell a straightforward story about internet usage in the EU. <br><br>

## _Data Sources_

**Synthetic Dataset** 

The synthetic dataset is crafted using Python, leveraging the power of random number generation, probability distributions, and controlled randomness with Numpy. This ensures a realistic representation based on EU demographics and fintech adoption probabilities. The Python script behind this process will be shared, allowing you to dive into the mechanics of how we shaped this synthetic landscape. <br><br>


**Real-Life Data**

In parallel, I've gathered real-life insights from Eurostat, a reliable source for European statistical information. The datasets include:

- <b>Individuals using the internet for internet banking</b>: Unveiling the digital banking landscape across the EU.

- <b>Individuals - internet activities</b>: Exploring the various online activities individuals engage in, providing a closer look at internet usage trends. 

- <b>Median income</b>: Offering insights into income distribution across different EU countries.

- <b>Median income by educational attainment level</b>: Highlighting the correlation between education and income.

- <b>Population by educational attainment level</b>: Providing a comprehensive view of the educational landscape within the EU.


Additionally, you'll find a file containing all Eurostat datasets used, cleaned and presented in Excel format. These datasets, extracted from Eurostat, form the foundation of our analysis. They allow for a thorough exploration of internet usage dynamics, considering demographic influencers and the spectrum of online activities.

## _Analysis Scripts_

### Synthetic Dataset Generator Fintech EU.py
This Python script generates a synthetic dataset that mimics the demographics and fintech adoption probabilities within the European Union (EU). The dataset is crafted using Eurostat data and introduces controlled randomness to ensure realistic representations.


#### Key Components:

#### 1. EU Country List:
- Defines a list of the 27 European Union countries for reference.

#### 2. Internet Banking Usage:
- Includes the percentage of individuals using the internet for banking in each EU country, sourced from Eurostat.

#### 3. Education Data:
- Provides the percentage distribution of the population by education level in each EU country, based on Eurostat data.

#### 4. Education Income:
- Specifies the median net income in each EU country according to different education levels, using Eurostat data.

#### 5. Age Weights:
- Adjusted weights for age groups based on their impact on income (weights' calculations based on Eurostat data).

#### 6. Functions:
   - `calculateIncome`: Calculates income based on country, age, and education level, incorporating controlled randomness.
   - `generateRandomEducationLevel`: Randomly selects an education level based on the distribution in educationData.
   - `generateSyntheticData`: Generates a synthetic dataset with specified demographic and fintech adoption features.

#### 7. Dataset Generation:
- Utilizes the defined functions to generate a synthetic dataset of 5000 records.
- Controls adjustments for age and education impact on internet usage for banking, maintaining realism.
- Caps internet usage at 100% and sets a minimum of 0%.

#### 8. Output:
- Exports the synthetic dataset to an Excel file named 'projectDataset.xlsx'.

This script acts as a powerful tool for creating a representative dataset, enabling exploration of EU fintech trends and analysis of internet usage patterns across different demographic factors.

### Weights Code - Impact of age on income.py
This Python script calculates income weights based on the median equivalised net income of the EU 27 countries for the year 2022, categorized into four age groups: 18-24, 25-49, 50-64, and 65+.

#### Key Components:

#### 1. Age Groups and Median Incomes:
- Defines age groups and their corresponding median equivalised net incomes based on Eurostat data.

#### 2. Total Income Calculation:
- Computes the total income across all age groups.

#### 3. Age Weights Calculation:
- Calculates the percentage contribution of each age group's income to the total income.
- Provides insights into how each age group contributes to the overall income distribution.

#### 4. Terminal Output:
- Prints the calculated age weights based on income distributions.

#### Example Output

```
Estimated age weights based on income distributions:
18-24: 23.37%
25-49: 26.05%
50-64: 27.87%
65+: 22.71%
```

This script serves as a crucial component for understanding the impact of age on income distributions within the EU. The displayed age weights offer valuable insights for further trend analysis, enabling a comprehensive examination of the relationship between age demographics and income trends.

Replace the last section of the main code in "Synthetic Dataset Generator Fintech EU.py" (from line 176) with the provided version in this script.

#### 2. Run the Script:
Execute the modified script to generate a synthetic dataset. During the process, the script will print detailed information for each generated record, including age, education level, original internet usage, age adjustment, education adjustment, and the final internet usage.

#### 3.Experiment with Weights:
Experiment with different weight values in the age and education adjustment sections (lines 195-225) to observe their impact on the internet usage values. Adjust weights and observe how the changes affect the final internet usage percentages.

#### 4.Terminal Output:
Monitor the terminal output to gain insights into how age and education adjustments influence internet usage. The script also calculates and prints the average internet usage for different age groups, providing a summary of the dataset.

#### Example Output

```
Age: 25, Education Level: Advanced
Original Internet Usage: 71.45
Age Adjustment: 2.8307014531357324, Education Adjustment: 1.0594935291138918
